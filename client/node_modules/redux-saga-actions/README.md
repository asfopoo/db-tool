# Newer version
Idea of `redux-saga-actions` has been reworked and published as [`redux-saga-routines`](https://github.com/afitiskin/redux-saga-routines). Before using this package, please take a look at new one!


# redux-saga-actions
An action creator for [Redux Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) compatible with [Redux Form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form). Forked from [redux-form-saga](https://github.com/mhssmnn/redux-form-saga)

## Why do I need this?

Reduce boilerplate from your source code when making requests to API or validating forms build on top of [Redux Form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form).

## Installation

```javascript
yarn add redux-saga-actions
```

**Important!** `redux-saga-actions` uses native *ES2015 Promises*, if the browser you are targeting doesn't support ES2015 Promises, you have provide a valid polyfill, such as [the one provided by `babel`](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/6.9.1/polyfill.js).

## Usage
First of all to enable `redux-saga-actions`, you have to add `actionsWatcherSaga` in your `sagaMiddleware.run()`, for example like this:
```javascript
const sagas = [yourFirstSaga, yourOtherSaga, ..., actionsWatcherSaga];
sagas.map(sagaMiddleware.run);
```

Then, use `createAction` to in your code:
```javascript
import { createAction } from 'redux-saga-actions';

// create action
const action = createAction('FETCH_DATA');

// now your action is a function that returns promise (useful for Redux Form users)
// action == (payload, dispatch) => Promise

// also, you have access to sub action types constants:
// action.REQUEST == 'FETCH_DATA_REQUEST';
// action.SUCCESS == 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS';
// action.FAILURE == 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE';

// and to of sub actions creators:
// action.request(payload) == { type: 'FETCH_DATA_REQUEST', payload };
// action.success(payload) == { type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload };
// action.failure(payload) == { type: 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE', payload };


// when you want to initialize data fetching, you need only to call action:
action(payload, dispatch);

// then, you need to handle action.REQUEST action in your own saga to perform API request:
function handleRequest() {
  try {
    // perform request to '/some_url' to fetch some data
    const response = yield call(apiClient.request, '/some_url');
    // if request successfully finished
    yield put(action.success(response.data));
  } catch (error) {
    // if request failed
    yield put(action.failure(response.error));
  }
}

function* handleRequestSaga() {
  yield takeEvery(action.REQUEST, handleRequest)
}
```


Result of `action(payload, dispatch)` is a Promise, so you can directly pass this function to Redux Form's `handleSubmit` to perform async validation:
```javascript
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(action)}>...</form>
```

To properly handle form errors you have to pass to `action.failure` instance of `SubmissionError`:
```javascript
yield put(action.failure(new SubmissionError(response.error)));
```


## Migration from `redux-form-saga`:

This package is 100% compatible with `redux-form-saga@0.0.7`, so feel free to use it:
```javascript
// you can either use old constants and function names:
import { PROMISE, createFormAction, formActionSaga } from 'redux-saga-actions';

// or new if you want:
import { PROMISE_ACTION, createAction, actionsWatcherSaga } from 'redux-saga-actions';
```

## Scripts
